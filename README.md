Medlab is a web community for doctors, which offers the possibility of publishing clinical cases, to help their own patients when the diagnosis is not clear or to help another doctor to solve their own, to initiate discussions on any topic about Medicine, to that various professionals in this field can contribute different points of view and interact with other doctors, and publish their articles, research or studies, a space in which they can share their work with the rest of the world or buy a book. 

In addition to doctors, there are other types of users, administrators, whose main function is to publish news, while any of the members, doctors and administrators, can search and post comments on the web or register books.

Currently, there are some little known applications, with which doctors can interact, but none of them have all the characteristics that this one does. The main purpose is to have a platform on which health professionals can advise or help each other, keep abreast of news and share their knowledge and wisdom.
